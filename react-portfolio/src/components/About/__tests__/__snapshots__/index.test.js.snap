      I love math problems. I love them so much that I became a math teacher and taught teenagers to love math problems too. (Or, at least I taught them to laugh at my jokes)
    </p>
    <p>
      When I started to include coding skills in my curriculum, I realized that I wanted to be the one to find innovative and effective solutions to real-world problems.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now I'm looking to be part of something bigger, outside of the classroom. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I currently work with JavaScript frameworks, and I'm hoping to grow and evolve by developing my skills using databases, back-end technologies, and many more.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm really excited to take the leap with the right organization and to start building!

      I'm really interested in optimization for efficiency and scalability. I'm also a big fan of unit tests. I love to find ways to refactor and improve my code and to incorporate new ideas or technologies.
